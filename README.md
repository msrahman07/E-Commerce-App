# E-Commerce-App

## Project Overview

E-Commerce-App is a comprehensive demonstration of an e-commerce application built with a full-stack approach. The backend is developed using ASP.NET Core 6, while the frontend is powered by Angular. PostgreSQL serves as the database, and Redis is employed for caching on the backend, contributing to optimized performance.

## Architecture and Design Patterns

The application is built upon a foundation of sound architectural principles and design patterns.

**Backend Architecture:**
- Clean Architecture
- Repository Pattern
- Generic Repository
- Specification Pattern
- SOLID Principles

## Features

**1. JWT Authentication:**
API endpoints are secured with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, implemented using ASP.NET Identity. This ensures secure access to the application.

**2. Caching with Redis:**
To enhance performance and minimize database calls, Redis is utilized for caching. This helps in providing swift responses to user queries.

**3. Pagination:**
The API includes pagination mechanisms to efficiently manage data load and accessibility, improving the user experience.

**4. Product Search and Filtering:**
A robust search and filtering functionality is implemented for products, enabling users to easily locate desired items.

**5. Error Handling and Validation:**
Comprehensive exception and HTTP error handling is integrated, ensuring that backend issues are handled gracefully. Validation mechanisms are implemented to provide user-friendly responses on the UI.

**6. Multi-Step Checkout Process:**
The application features a multi-step checkout process, streamlining the purchasing experience for users.

**7. Payment Processing with Stripe:**
Payment processing is facilitated through the integration of Stripe, a widely used payment gateway. This enables secure and seamless financial transactions.
